PYTHON PROJECT
BY: VANSHIKA SRIVASTAVA

Hello, I am Vanshika! 
This project combines all the Python knowledge I've acquired to date.
 It's a jumbled word game that includes Python's built-in random module and sample () method.
Game Process:
   - The program includes a list of words.
 - The computer chooses a random word from the    list and by using functions it is send to jumbled function where the random word is jumbled and returned.
   - The users are asked to provide their names   respectively. 
   - The users then guesses jumbled word given to them one by one. 
   - If they don’t guess right a message will be displayed “better luck, next time” and chance will be given to another user.
We can increase the complexity by adding more games and can give it another name as GAME HUB.
And there is an international Olympiad called QUIZBEE so if we want then we can make it game for that event as well. 

OBJECTIVE:
This project is intended to provide users with an interactive and enjoyable experience, challenging them to solve the word within a set number of tries.
I have taken the help from you tube and geeks for geeks website.
